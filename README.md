# Gesture-Recognition-for-Specially-Abled

• Focused on the recognition of the static sign language gestures and deep learning approach to recognize 24 alphabets and 0-9 digits.
• Using convolutional neural networks, created a classifier that can recognize static sign language gestures with high accuracy. Achieved an improved accuracy of 74% as we include more data from different subjects during training and created a simple Java GUI application to test our classifier.
